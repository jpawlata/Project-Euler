# Problem 6:
# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 12+22+...+102=385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1+2+...+10)2=552=3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.


# natural numbers > 0 (1, 2, 3, 4 ... )

# absolute value of the difference
